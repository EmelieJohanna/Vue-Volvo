# firstVueProject

This project involves recreating Volvo's landing page as a personal study to enhance my understanding of Vue.js. As this is my first experience working with Vue, I aim to explore its core features and capabilities while gaining practical knowledge of building a responsive and interactive web application.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
